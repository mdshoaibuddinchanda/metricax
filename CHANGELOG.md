### Version 0.1.0 - Initial Release

MetricaX 0.1.0 represents a professional-grade mathematical toolkit designed for production use in data science, machine learning, and scientific computing applications.

**Key Highlights:**
- **40+ mathematical functions** across Bayesian statistics and information theory
- **Production-ready code** with comprehensive testing and documentation
- **Zero dependencies** for maximum compatibility and minimal overhead
- **Professional structure** suitable for enterprise environments

**Target Users:**
- Data scientists and machine learning engineers
- Researchers in statistics and information theory

- Students and educators in mathematical sciences

**Getting Started:**
```bash
pip install metricax
```

**Quick Example:**
```python
import metricax.bayesian as mb
import metricax.info_theory as it

# Bayesian A/B testing
posterior_alpha, posterior_beta = mb.update_beta_binomial(1, 1, 15, 85)
conversion_rate = mb.beta_mean(posterior_alpha, posterior_beta)

# Information theory analysis
entropy = it.entropy([0.5, 0.3, 0.2])
kl_div = it.kl_divergence([0.5, 0.5], [0.3, 0.7])
```
